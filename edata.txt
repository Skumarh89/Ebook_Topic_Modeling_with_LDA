To improve the accuracy of the model, we can make several changes and enhancements. Here are some suggestions:
    1. More Data: Increasing the size of the training dataset can often lead to improved model performance. If possible, try to gather more training data.
    2. Data Augmentation: You already have a data augmentation step in your code, which is beneficial for increasing the effective size of your training data. You can experiment with different augmentation techniques, such as random deletions, insertions, or substitutions of bases.
    3. Model Architecture: You can try different LSTM architectures or consider using more complex models like GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) or Bidirectional LSTMs. Additionally, you can experiment with adding more layers to the model or using deeper architectures.
    4. Regularization: Introduce regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting. This can be especially helpful when working with limited training data.
    5. Learning Rate Scheduling: Instead of using a fixed learning rate, you can implement learning rate scheduling, where the learning rate is adjusted during training. This approach can help the model converge faster and potentially reach a better minimum.
    6. Batch Normalization: Adding batch normalization layers to the model can help stabilize and speed up the training process.
    7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameter settings, such as the number of hidden units, the number of layers, the batch size, and the number of epochs.
    8. Evaluation Metrics: Consider using additional evaluation metrics apart from Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score. For instance, you can calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to get a clearer picture of the model's performance.
    9. Learning from Pretrained Models: If you have access to a large dataset, you can use transfer learning by first training the model on a larger dataset and then fine-tuning it on your specific task.
    10. Check Data Quality: Ensure that the training and test datasets are balanced and representative of the problem. Also, verify the correctness of your data preparation functions.
Remember that improving accuracy might require a combination of these strategies, and it's essential to experiment and fine-tune your approach based on the specific problem and dataset you are working with.





ii) Trained a LSTM network with different hyper-parameter (Number of layers, hidden size, learning rate, epochs, loss functions, optimizer, batch size)
iii) Trained a BiLSTM network and follow the above mentioned approaches 
iv) Make use of Fast Text embedding : the model can capture more informative representations of the input DNA sequences, which may improve the performance of the CpG Detector.


i) Data Augmentation:  Data augmentation techniques can be beneficial when there is a lack of data, but in this case, generating more diverse samples may not help improve the model's performance significantly. CpG detection is a specific task that requires the model to understand the patterns of consecutive CGs, and simply augmenting the data with variations may not provide additional insights for the model to generalize better.
In the context of DNA sequences, this may involve negative sampling to create non-CpG regions. However, since the task is specific to counting CpGs, introducing non-CpG regions might have caused confusion for the model, making it harder to learn the pattern of CpGs accurately.

ii) LSTM with Hyperparameter Variations: Different hyperparameter variations were tried to optimize the model's performance. However, using only 2048 data samples for training might not have been sufficient for the LSTM to generalize well. LSTM-based models typically require a large amount of data to achieve better performance.
iii) BiLSTM: BiLSTM is known for its ability to capture bidirectional context, which can be advantageous for certain tasks. However, in CpG detection, the sequence structure of DNA is relatively straightforward, and the bidirectional context may not add significant value. Again, the limited dataset size may hinder the model's ability to leverage the benefits of BiLSTM effectively.
iv) FastText Embedding:  While FastText embeddings are powerful for capturing semantic relationships in text data, DNA sequences have a unique structure and composition. Using pre-trained embeddings may not be suitable for this domain, as the embeddings might not capture the specific patterns and motifs related to CpGs accurately. It is crucial to allow the model to learn from the raw DNA sequences directly to tackle this task effectively.
Reasons for Poor Performance:
    1. Limited Data: Training deep learning models, especially with LSTM-based networks, typically demands a large dataset to generalize well. With only 2048 data samples, the model might not have had enough diverse examples to learn the complex patterns of CpGs effectively.
    2. Overfitting: With a limited dataset and complex models, overfitting becomes a concern. The models might have memorized the training data instead of generalizing to new, unseen data.
    3. Lack of Pre-training: Pre-training on a large corpus or using pre-trained embeddings (like FastText) may improve model performance. However, pre-training specific to DNA sequences could be challenging due to the uniqueness of genomic data.
    4. Complex Task: Counting CpGs in DNA sequences is a specialized and challenging task. It's possible that even with extensive experimentation, the model complexity required to accurately perform this task was beyond the capabilities of the limited data available.
Overall, the primary reason for the approaches' failure is the limited dataset size. Neural networks, especially deep learning models like LSTM and BiLSTM, require a considerable amount of data to learn complex patterns effectively. With only 2048 data samples, the models may struggle to generalize well to unseen sequences. 
Recommendation: To improve the performance of the CpG Detector, it is crucial to acquire a larger dataset with diverse DNA sequences. Additionally, transfer learning or pre-training on a relevant biological dataset (Ex: BioBERT model) might be beneficial. Further, regularization techniques and model architectures suitable for smaller datasets could be explored to prevent overfitting. Collaboration with bioinformatics experts might also provide valuable insights for enhancing the model's capabilities in this domain.
